    Forensic Science and Toxicology

    Bloodstains are frequently encountered in crime scenes. Accurately
    estimating a bloodstain's age is paramount to criminal investigation but
    challenging. Scientific methods such as high-performance liquid
    chromatography (HPLC), RNA degradation, and the analysis of serum (the
    plasma of the blood after clotting factors have been removed) have been
    explored but have limited forensic application due to multiple factors. For
    example, the last technique mentioned is not a good approach to most
    investigations due to the amount of blood found on the crime scene rarely
    being sufficient to extract the ideal amount of serum to analyze. In recent
    case studies, gaining popularity around 2017, vibrational spectroscopy
    techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, are
    gaining popularity as fast, non-destructive, quantitative, and precise
    methods. More specifically, attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR is known
    to be one of the most common measurement techniques for FTIR, due to its
    broad range of applications and accuracy. One of those applications is,
    precisely, investigating the age of the bloodstain. FTIR is efficient in
    identifying and quantifying bloodstain degradation due to occurrences such
    as autoxidation of hemoglobin when blood is exposed to air. In multiple
    publications from 2017-2020, ATR-FTIR is experimentally used to
    differentiate bloodstains by age, bloodstains found both outdoors and
    indoors. Results consistently showed that, as the period in which the
    bloodstain was exposed increased, the absorbance values collected from the
    spectroscopy analysis decreased. This is attributed to the structural
    changes in hemoglobin. Other discoveries obtained from this analysis were
    different peaks observed in each FTIR spectrum for each blood type. For
    example, peaks at 1033 cm−1 and 2844 cm−1 are present in AB and O blood and
    absent in A and B blood.

    In forensic science the combinations of the disciplines of science and the
    law, different instruments or techniques regularly used in labs can be
    applied to solving a case. The fingerprint has been a staple of forensic
    investigation, Sir Francis Galton is recognized as the first person to
    publish a classification system for fingerprinting and noting their main
    features of loops, whorls, and arches in the 19th century. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) has been a hot button topic in recent years due to its
    variety of versatility in the artistic, corporate world, and also within the
    industry of forensics. There are some current applications of the technology
    as well as many potential implications in the field. One current application
    of the technology has been for analyzing digital evidence, for detecting
    faces and objects. It can also be a quick way to extract texts of interest
    from documents, however, recently there have been some experimental
    applications of the technology. Earlier this January Columbia University’s
    undergraduate engineers have utilized AI to analyze the uniqueness,
    characterized by forensic contributors such as Galton, and have claimed in
    their research that fingerprints may not differ too much from person to
    person. Though their paper has been rejected by well-established forensic
    journals, the team claims that the AI, which has been fed 60,000 prints from
    a public U.S government database, uses a different kind of marker than the
    traditional branching and endpoints observed. The technology used the angles
    and curvature of swirls and loops in the center of the fingerprint. This
    demonstrates that AI has a potential in improving accuracy within the field.
    It is worth noting the team creating using this technology had no prior
    knowledge of forensics and the system they were using had been only working
    with thousands of fingerprints, so access to broader datasets would be
    needed for more careful validation. The paper they created was appealed by a
    professor of innovation in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and was
    accepted for publication by Science Advances. The professor discussed that
    this research into AI could help provide knowledge for pre-existing forensic
    datasets, which could have major implications in the field, such as properly
    convicting or acquitting others.
